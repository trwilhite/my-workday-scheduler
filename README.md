# Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to use JQuery and moment.js (and more) to create an interactive workday scheduler that would allow a user to dynamically save events for each hour of the day. The scheduler was to meet the following criteria:
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Description
For this project, we were given a starter code that included partial HTML and complete CSS. I used moment.js to track the time so that the timeblocks would update colors/classes accordingly, and so that the current date would display at the top of the scheduler page. I also used JQuery to create functions that would allow users to save their tasks to local storage, and to set it so that upon refresh, the page would display the saved events.
